<p>Crane Beach in Barbados has been voted one of the world's best and The Crane Resort sits on its pink sands. Dining avoids the buffet option often seen elsewhere, with restaurants including L'Azure offering fresh seafood overlooking the ocean or Italian classics at D'Onofrio's Trattoria.</p>
<p>At their Bar 1887, rum punch is on the menu, as well as the promise that "happy hour can be every hour." The resort features six swimming pools, waterfalls, whirlpools and private pools, gardens and terraces.
From $1,651 per couple for a three-night stay.<p>

  <p>UNICO Riviera Maya, Mexico</p>
<p>Unlimited spa treatments, golf and off-property excursions are some of the draws at the UNICO 20°87° Hotel Riviera Maya. The recently-opened property is adults only and intriguingly named after its latitude and longitude on the Yucatan Peninsula.</p>
<p>They also offer an app that promises to allow you to order pretty much anything via your phone -- and open your room door. A dirty martini to your sunbed? Housekeeping to make up the room?
When you can drag yourself away, there are five globally-inspired gourmet restaurants, six bars and lounges and three pools.</p>
